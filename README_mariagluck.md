# Inputs and Outputs

Write down pseudo-code on pen and paper for the following patterns:

1.  Input => Output
    2, 5 => 5
    0, 100 => 100
    52, 35 => 52

If there is a 2 and a 5 (input), then return a 5 (output).
If there is a 0 and a 100, then return a 100.
If there is a 52 and a 32, then return a 52.

2.  Input => Output
    5, 5 => true
    40, 40 => true
    50, 51 => false

If there is a 5 and a 5 then returns as true.
If there is a 40 and a 40 then returns as true.
If there is a 50 and a 51 then it returns as false.

3.  Input => Output
    110, 100 => true
    150, 100 => true
    50, 100 => false

If there is a 110 and a 100, it returns as true.
If there is a 150 and a 100, it returns as true.
If there is a 50 and a 100, it returns as false.
