# Inputs and Outputs

Write down pseudo-code on pen and paper for the following patterns:

1.
Input   =>	Output
2, 5	  =>  5
0, 100	=>  100
52, 35	=>  52 -->

If a 2 and 5 are present, output the 5
Output any input over 99
All numbers ending with 2 should be printed as output 

2.
Input	   =>   Output
5, 5     =>   true
40, 40   =>   true
50, 51   =>   false

If there are 2 numbers that match, print true
If there are numbers that do Not, print false

3.
Input	     =>   Output
110, 100	 =>   true
150, 100	 =>   true
50, 100	   =>   false

All numerical inputs that are a multiple of 10 output as true
All even numbers output as true
If numbers are not the same, output as false
